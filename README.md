Being surrounded by the agriculture and farmlands here at UC Davis, we were inspired to create a project that could help farmers and gardeners quickly diagnose their crops and receive treatment advice and more information from reputable sites. Recognizing the importance of sustainable farming practices in an ever-populating world, we believe that crop disease detection is a key part of shaping efficient food-growing practices and mitigating the spread of threatening diseases.
